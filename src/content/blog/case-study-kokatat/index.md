# My Professional Creative Journey: From Multimedia Storytelling to Digital Experience Design

For over a decade, my career has lived at the intersection of **storytelling, technology, and visual communication**. What started as hands-on video production and editing has grown into a multidisciplinary creative path spanning multimedia development, broadcast engineering, front-end development, and digital strategy. My work has taken me through newsrooms, production studios, and large-scale e-commerce platforms — all rooted in my belief that **creative storytelling is amplified by strong, accessible digital experiences**.

# 🧩 Evolving Into a Creative Technologist: Web Developer (2019–Present)

Beginning in 2019, my career entered a new phase — moving into professional **front-end and e-commerce development** while maintaining my creative identity as a storyteller. This blended background allowed me to become a hybrid creator–developer with a strong command of UX, content, and technical implementation.

### **Overdose (2019–2024)**  
*Web Developer → Development Lead → Development Team Lead*  

Across nearly five years at Overdose, I worked on BigCommerce and Shopify Plus storefronts for enterprise clients. I evolved into a technical leader who:

- Built custom UI components and accessible front-end experiences  
- Consulted on headless builds, platform extensibility, and omnichannel strategy  
- Led Agile sprints and cross-functional development teams  
- Ran technical workshops and built proofs of concept  
- Mentored developers and served as the primary technical point of contact  


This period strengthened my ability to bridge creative direction with technical execution.

### **IG Design Group Americas / Advantus Corp (2024–2025)**

At IG Design Group, I spearheaded BigCommerce storefront improvements, integrated APIs, and optimized digital experience performance. I partnered closely with product and marketing teams, shaping both user experience and content strategy.
