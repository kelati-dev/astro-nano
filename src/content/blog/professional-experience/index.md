# My Professional Creative Journey: From Multimedia Storytelling to Digital Experience Design

For over a decade, my career has lived at the intersection of **storytelling, technology, and visual communication**. What started as hands-on video production and editing has grown into a multidisciplinary creative path spanning multimedia development, broadcast engineering, front-end development, and digital strategy. My work has taken me through newsrooms, production studios, and large-scale e-commerce platforms — all rooted in my belief that **creative storytelling is amplified by strong, accessible digital experiences**.
