Across nearly five years at Overdose, I worked on BigCommerce and Shopify Plus storefronts for enterprise clients. I evolved into a technical leader who:

- Built custom UI components and accessible front-end experiences  
- Consulted on headless builds, platform extensibility, and omnichannel strategy  
- Led Agile sprints and cross-functional development teams  
- Ran technical workshops and built proofs of concept  
- Mentored developers and served as the primary technical point of contact
